# Example Project using Nimble via Carthage
This project is for providing to JetBrains to illustrate an AppCode bug that I think is happening due to some 
frameworks I'm using via Carthage.  However, it is also an example Swift 3/Xcode 8.3.1 project integrating Quick/Nimble
(and LogKit) via Carthage.
